# MorphoTetra
Repository for the project of tetrahedral meshes generation from biological 3D images.

## Subject 
The aim of this project is to provide a system for intuitively generating surface meshes representing the interfaces between cells in order to allow interactive exploration of this data by biologists.

One approach would be to generate tetrahedral meshes at different resolutions [[Faraj 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849316300620)] and extract the interfaces.

This project is based on a previous TER : [github link](https://github.com/Isnao/TER_GenMaillage)
